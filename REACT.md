### REGARDING REACT
- To learn React: [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
- Bootstrap with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Available Scripts From `.`
  - `npm start` runs app in dev mode
    - Launches [local browser app](http://localhost:3000)
    - Page reloads on File edits.
    - Console displays lint errors
  - `npm test` Launches test runner in [interactive watch mode](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).
  - `npm run build` Builds production app  to `build` folder for [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
    - Bundles React in production mode
    - Optimizes/Minifies build for performance
    - Ensures Filenames include hashes.
  -  `npm run eject` removes single build dependency from project
     - **Note: this is a one-way operation.** 
     - **Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
     - Copies  configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc)  into your project
     - All the commands except `eject` 
       - will still work
       - but point to copied tweakable scripts
       - You don’t have to ever use `eject`.
